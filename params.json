Durante a votação, os congressistas justificaram ou dedicaram seus votos das formas mais diversas. Esse projeto constroi word clouds - desenhos onde as palavras mais frequentes em um texto aparecem em tamanho maior - com base nos discursos dos deputados. As imagens estão logo a baixo e foram consideradas as 200 palavras mais frequentes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_English_\r\n\r\nBrazil is in the middle of a political crisis. You can get a nice overview of the situation in [this amazing video by Vlogbrothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFKsY5O7oYs).\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently, our Congress voted to impeach our president. When the deputies casted their votes, they had 10s to justify it. Some used their time on the microphone to actually express their reasons. Some used it to dedicate their votes to their home state, their families, their grandkids and so on. One deputy used his time to honor Carlos Ustra, a torturer for the former military dictatorship.\r\n\r\nWe are in a very delicate situation. Our political future is, at best, uncertain and the ground keeps shifting below our feet.\r\n\r\nThis is a programmer's attempt to make any sense out of this mess.\r\n\r\n## Todos os Votos (all votes)\r\n![todos os votos](/all.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Votos pelo impeachment (votes pro-impeachment)\r\n![](/yes.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Votos contra o impeachment (votes pro-government)\r\n![](/no.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Votos das mulheres (Women's votes)\r\n![](/women.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Votos dos homens (Men's votes)\r\n![](/men.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThe font I use, NotoSerif, has an Apache licensing but my code I keep as MIT.\r\n\r\nImpeachment Cloud\r\nCopyright © 2016 FBidu\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"),\r\nto deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation\r\nthe rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,\r\nand/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\r\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\r\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\r\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM,\r\nDAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\r\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE\r\nOR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\r\n",
