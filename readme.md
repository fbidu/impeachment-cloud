A nossa câmara dos deputados aprovou recentemente a abertura do processo de impeachment de Dilma Rousseff. Durante a votação, os congressistas justificaram ou dedicaram seus votos das formas mais diversas. Esse projeto constroi word clouds - desenhos onde as palavras mais frequentes em um texto aparecem em tamanho maior - com base nos discursos dos deputados. As imagens estão logo a baixo e foram consideradas as 200 palavras mais frequentes.


_English_

Brazil is in the middle of a political crisis. You can get a nice overview of the situation in [this amazing video by Vlogbrothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFKsY5O7oYs).


Recently, our Congress voted to impeach our president. When the deputies casted their votes, they had 10s to justify it. Some used their time on the microphone to actually express their reasons. Some used it to dedicate their votes to their home state, their families, their grandkids and so on. One deputy used his time to honor Carlos Ustra, a torturer for the former military dictatorship.

We are in a very delicate situation. Our political future is, at best, uncertain and the ground keeps shifting below our feet.

This is a programmer's attempt to make any sense out of this mess.
