# Impeachment cloud

Brazil is in the middle of a political crisis. You can get a nice overview of the situation in [this amazing video by Vlogbrothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFKsY5O7oYs).


Recently, our Congress voted to impeach our president. When the deputies casted their votes, they had 10s to justify it. Some used their time on the microphone to actually express their reasons. Some used it to dedicate their votes to their home state, their families, their grandkids and so on. One deputy used his time to honor Carlos Ustra, a torturer for the former military dictatorship. Both men forever scarred Brazil's democracy.


This is a programmer's attempt to make any sense out of this mess.
